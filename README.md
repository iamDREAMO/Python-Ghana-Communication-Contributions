# Acceptance

Dear Sabrina Henry,



**Appreciation for OffSec's Sponsorship and Plan for Execution**

On behalf of the Python Ghana Community, we would like to express our deepest gratitude for the generous offer of 10 OffSec Sponsored Invitations. We are thrilled and honoured to be selected for this opportunity, and we believe it will greatly benefit our community members and promote cybersecurity education in our region.

After careful consideration and consultation with our members, we have decided to split the sponsored invitations into two groups to cater to different skill levels. Here's our plan for executing this program:

**Beginners Level:**

We would like to allocate five invitations for the "Learn Fundamentals" course. This one-year access to level 100 content and assessments will serve as an excellent starting point for those who are new to cybersecurity and wish to lay a solid foundation in the field.

**Intermediate-Advanced Level:**

The remaining five invitations will be allocated to the "Course and Cert Exam Bundle." Our community members will have the option to choose from the following courses: WEB-200 (OSWA), SOC-200 (OSDA), EXP-312 (OSMR), or PEN-200 (PWK). We believe this bundle, which includes 90 days of lab access, course materials, and one exam attempt, will offer a challenging and rewarding experience for those with prior knowledge in cybersecurity.

To facilitate the distribution of invitations, we will require the following information:

**List of Student Email Addresses and Selected Courses:**

Student 1: \[Email Address], Course: \[Selected Course]

Student 2: \[Email Address], Course: \[Selected Course]

Student 3: \[Email Address], Course: \[Selected Course] ...

Please find the requested information above and kindly issue the invitation links to the respective students. We will ensure that all our students complete the registration via the Offensive Security Training Library before the lab time begins.

We understand the value of such professional training and certifications and are confident that it will make a positive impact on the participants' careers and cybersecurity knowledge.

If you need any further information or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to continuing our collaboration and fostering a stronger cybersecurity community.\


Best regards,\
